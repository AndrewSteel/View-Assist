# Thermostat Control

Control your thermostat device using voice.  User can say 'Raise temperature 2 degrees' or 'Set thermostat to 68 degrees'

* Import [raw blueprint](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dinki/View-Assist/viewassist-thermostatcontrol/View%20Assist%20custom%20sentences/Thermostat%20Control/blueprint-thermostatcontrol.yaml) and configure
* Create [thermostat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dinki/View-Assist/viewassist-thermostatcontrol/View%20Assist%20dashboard%20and%20views/views/thermostat/thermostat.yaml) view

This blueprint is working for me but may take additional work for users with different thermostats.  I won't know until people test it.
