# Play Music with Music Assistant

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the blueprint import dialog with a specific blueprint pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fdinki%2FView-Assist%2Fmain%2FView+Assist+custom+sentences%2FPlay+Music+with+Music+Assistant%2Fblueprint-playmusicwithmusicassistant.yaml)

Requirements:
  * Music Assistant server installed and integrated with Home Assistant
  * Music view (see views 'music)  will update path when available
This blueprint assumes you will be playing music to your View ASsist satellite configured media player and that it has a corresponding Music Assistant device (eg VA media player device _2)
  * The recently added musicplayer_device must be added to your View Assistant device configuration as explained in the [Satellite Custom Device Configuration](https://github.com/dinki/View-Assist/wiki/View-Assist-device-configuration#satellite-custom-device-configuration) portion of the wiki.  This should be a Music Assistant player device.  Typically these will be named the same as your mediaplayer_device but with a _2 on the end
