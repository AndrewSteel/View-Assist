# Welcome to View Assist

View Assist provides visual feedback for the Home Assistant Assist voice assistant using a collection of different automations, custom sentences, scripts, and extensions with the view being displayed on any Android device. The project is at proof-of-concept (POC) phase but is fully functional.

You can [watch a detailed demo of the project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jG4LZzKqs&t=197s) that was debuted as part of the Home Assistant Voice Contest Winners Livestream.
