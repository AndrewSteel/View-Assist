# Home Assistant Configuration
Several Home Assistant custom integrations (or custom_components as they are often referred to) are used for several pieces of the View Assist flow.  These can all be installed using the **Home Assistant Community Store (HACS)**.  If you do not have HACS installed, [visit the official documentation](https://hacs.xyz/docs/setup/prerequisites) for instructions and then return here to proceed.

**Required**
- **[Browser Mod](browsermod)** - allows switching views and routing playback audio to your tablet
- **[Stream Assist](streamassist)** - listens to audio coming from tablet to process wake word and pass to Assist Pipeline
