View Assist is easily extendable by adding custom views which receive data from custom sentences. On this page you will find a gallery of premade custom views. You will find links to the requirements and installation instructions.

We encourage everyone to share their creations so that others might enjoy what you have brought to life.

All views can be added using the instructions found here: https://github.com/dinki/View-Assist/wiki/View-Assist-dashboard-and-views#view-installation
