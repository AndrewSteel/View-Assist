# Readying Your Tablet

An Android device is used for the display, voice input, and audio output. The device used for the POC is a 2016 Amazon Fire 7HD tablet running Android 5. It's because of this I am confident to say that this method should work on any device that is that old or newer. Wake Word detection is done on your Home Assistant instance as audio is constantly being streamed from your tablet to your HA server.
