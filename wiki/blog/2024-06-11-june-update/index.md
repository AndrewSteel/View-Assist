We are closing in on complete roll out with only a few more items needing to be sorted.  I am pleased to say that support for the project is fantastic with a good number of folks helping out on Discord.  We are growing in number of both Discord users and Youtube subscribers which gives the project more visibility and the number of people lending a hand is growing in turn.  The goal is to have everything rolled out and start pumping out custom sentences and views to expand the capabilities of View Assist.
