It's been a while since the last update but this is not due to lack of activity.  Things are really coming together and the wish list items have been getting checked off regularly.  We are making great strides and several users including myself have been able to put these devices into daily use in replacement of their commercial voice assistants.  Things are not perfect but they are definitely getting better daily with the help of a bunch of different folks making contributions and offering guidance.  It is greatly appreciated and I am excited to see where we will be in the coming months.
