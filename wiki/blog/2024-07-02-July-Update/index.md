Our rollout for core functionality has been completed and I am happy to report that the number of users using View Assist is growing every day.  Our Discord server continues to offer great support on both the hardware side (TSV in particular), troubleshooting, and development. We are currently working on additional functionality through additional views and custom sentence blueprints.  Stay tuned for more!
