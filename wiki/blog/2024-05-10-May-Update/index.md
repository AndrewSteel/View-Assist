Things are pretty crazy with work and life events but these should settle down next week.  Despite this I have managed to release a few videos.  I'll be honest, I am not in this to make flashy Youtube videos with cool WLED lighting.  What you see is what you get.  I am here to help others set up View Assist and to build a foundation for easy to share, expandable functionality for Assist with all satellites being able to operate both as a group and individually.  The videos are one shot recordings and there will be hiccups but I'll do my best to address anything needing to be corrected in the comments and here on the wiki.  The videos are really a means to provide additional context to the wiki.

If you haven't checked out the Youtube channel please take a look and, not to sound clich√©, like, subscribe, and comment as this will help draw a larger audience and perhaps some other contributors.

All videos and wiki pages are now available for creating the Assist satellite devices using Stream Assist for wake word detection.  At present, someone should be able to go through the wiki and/or Youtube videos and install the components necessary to create a device that will listen for wake word and then action and respond.  Next steps are underway for tying these devices into the View Assist system.  The first video for this was uploaded today with a few more to follow before the complete View Assist configuration series is complete.  We have some good folks beta testing VA on the Discord channel and it is fantastic to see them get their VA system running and the excitement that follows.  More good stuff coming soon.
